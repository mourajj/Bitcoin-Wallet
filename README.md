## BONUS / REQUIREMENTS:

### Load Testing - "How many requests per second your endpoints can make?"

There is a folder in this repository called "loadTesting", it contains 5 .js files, each file is related to an endpoint which you can perform load tests by using this following command:

```bash
  k6 run deposit.js
```
To run these tests, you need to install an [open-source load testing tool called K6](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) (It's really easy to install).
 
You can specify the amount of Virtual Users and also the time that the load test will run, feel free to check it out =)

### "We donâ€™t like empty databases =)" 

Neither do I, therefore, there is folder called "sql" where you can see 2 files, one of them is the command to create the database and all of its tables, and the other is to insert some data on it.

### "If something wrong happens, how does your system let everybody know it?"

For each unexpected situation, there is HTTP return code and also an error message, feel free to try out!

### "How can we measure the latency of the external APIs calls?"

This can also be done with the K6 tool, if you want to test the external api delay, please refer to the balance.js file and take a look in my comment.
